Run The Bot

## Setup

1. **Open `refs.txt`:**

   Open a file named `refs.txt` in the project directory and add one referral code per line.

   Example:
   ```
   REFERRAL_CODE_1
   REFERRAL_CODE_2
   REFERRAL_CODE_3
   ```

2. **Create `proxies.txt` (Optional but recommended):**

   Create a file named `proxies.txt` in the project directory and add one proxy URL per line.

   Example:
   ```
   http://username:password@proxy1.example.com:port
   http://username:password@proxy2.example.com:port
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, execute:

- Multi Referral
```bash
node multi.js
```
- Single Referral
```bash
node main.js
```
- Auto Task using token // use this if there's a new task, you can simply find the taskid through Network Tab and replace the Id's, I do that so its way safer
```bash
node autotask.js
```
- Auto Extract Referral Code from `accounts.txt`
```bash
node refcodeextractor.js
```


## Customization

- **Task IDs:**  
  The four mission IDs are hardcoded in the script. You can update or add more as needed.
